    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Covid-19 pandemic shook the world and had a catastrophic impact on countries around the globe. Millions died, and in an effort to help global stability and promote world health and peace, our project looks to aid in pandemic prevention using a groundbreaking method.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using a worldwide web of interconnected particle detecting modules powered with AI detection software, we propose a state-of-the-art detection system that is cost-effective and standardized for an international level. This system has the potential to prevent another catastrophe and save millions of lives through early detection and geographical data about origins of potentially deadly diseases as well as bio-terrorist threats.
