    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Covid-19 pandemic shook the world and had a catastrophic impact on countries around the globe. Millions died, and in an effort to help global stability and promote world health and peace, our project looks to aid in pandemic prevention using a groundbreaking method.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using a worldwide web of specialized continuous ambient air sampling systems powered with AI detection software, 
        we propose a state-of-the-art detection system that is cost-effective and standardized for an international level. 
        This proposed system offers the ability to prevent another catastrophe by migrating from outbreak surveillance to 
        outbreak forecast. We can save millions of lives through early detection and geographical data about origins of 
        potentially deadly diseases as well as bio-terrorist threats. The real time genometric sequencing data obtained 
        through this system is a unique capability never before seen that can be used to track antigenic drift and antigenic shift.

    <h2>Pharmaceutical Incentive</h2>
    <p>
        When looking at pharmaceutical incentive, operational revenue growth for Pfizer was 6% in 2021 if you exclude Pfizer’s COVID-19 
        related products such as Comirnaty (the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine) and Paxlovid (an oral COVID-19 treatment). 
        When you include these COVID-19 related products, the operational revenue growth is 92%. Also, R&D expenses rose by approximately 
        $4.4 billion. This indicates a strong engagement of Pfizer in pandemic mitigation strategies.
