        <h2>Why AI?</h2>
        <p>
            Once trapped by the electrospray capture technology, a method that charges tiny water droplets to attract and trap airborne 
            pathogens, the AI detection CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) analyzes 
            them to identify what kind of pathogen it is. This method is quick and can be done in real-time, making it a powerful tool 
            for early detection of diseases and potentially stopping outbreaks before they spread. This method stands out by offering 
            precise identification capabilities that improve with exposure to more data than traditional diagnostic techniques.

        <h2>Is it reliable?</h2>
        <p>
            Using a worldwide web of specialized continuous ambient air sampling systems powered with AI detection software, 
            we propose a state-of-the-art detection system that is cost-effective and standardized for an international level. 
            This proposed system offers the ability to prevent another catastrophe by migrating from outbreak surveillance to 
            outbreak forecast. We can save millions of lives through early detection and geographical data about origins of 
            potentially deadly diseases as well as bio-terrorist threats. The real time genometric sequencing data obtained 
            through this system is a unique capability never before seen that can be used to track antigenic drift and antigenic shift.
