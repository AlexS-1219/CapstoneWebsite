                “I don't know; we don't know; nobody knows what's coming next,” emphasized Jacob Lemieux, Harvard Medical School 
                assistant professor of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital during a recent symposium hosted by the HMS-led 
                Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness, or MassCPR.

                    “The interval between pandemics is, cruelly, often just long enough that we forget, and just short enough that they 
                    happen repeatedly during our lifetimes,” Lemieux said.

                The technology responsible for identifying the micro-organisms is the AI powered captcha system. Essentially,
                it will look at slides of samples taken by the electrospray device and indentify the microbiles so that researchers
                can be more aware of what's out there.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This is the current leading technology for capturing samples for the AI detection system, others may be more useful though.

                The Pilot Proposal tab takes advantage of an embedded map showing data that may be useful for deciding on which locations
                would be ideal for pilot testing.

                The purpose of this site is to inform you on the advantages of using such technology, not only for public health but,
                pharmacutical companies may be interested in this data collection due to the profitablity of expanding research on active
                disease.
