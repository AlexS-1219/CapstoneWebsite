            <h2>Introduction to AI Detection</h2>
            <p>
                The technology responsible for identifying the micro-organisms is the AI powered captcha system. Essentially,
                it will look at slides of samples taken by the electrospray device and indentify the microbiles so that researchers
                can be more aware of what's out there.

            <h2>Electrospray technology</h2>
            <p>
                This is the current leading technology for capturing samples for the AI detection system, others may be more useful though.

            <h2>Pilot Proposals</h2>
            <p>
                The Pilot Proposal tab takes advantage of an embedded map showing data that may be useful for deciding on which locations
                would be ideal for pilot testing.
